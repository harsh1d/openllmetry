# Mentor Matching Algorithm

Here's a high-level overview of a mentor matching algorithm:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Collect Mentor Profiles]
    B --> C[Collect Mentee Profiles]
    C --> D[Define Matching Criteria]
    D --> E[Calculate Compatibility Scores]
    E --> F[Rank Potential Matches]
    F --> G[Propose Top Matches]
    G --> H[Review and Confirm Matches]
    H --> I[End]
```

Key steps in the algorithm:

1. **Collect Mentor Profiles:** Gather information about mentors, including skills, experience, availability, and preferences.
2. **Collect Mentee Profiles:** Gather information about mentees, including goals, areas of interest, and preferences.
3. **Define Matching Criteria:** Establish factors for determining compatibility, such as skill alignment, experience level, and scheduling preferences.
4. **Calculate Compatibility Scores:** Use a weighted scoring system to evaluate how well each mentor-mentee pair matches based on the defined criteria.
5. **Rank Potential Matches:** Sort the potential matches based on their compatibility scores.
6. **Propose Top Matches:** Present the highest-ranking matches to mentors and mentees for consideration.
7. **Review and Confirm Matches:** Allow mentors and mentees to review proposed matches and confirm or reject them.

This algorithm can be refined and optimized based on feedback and success rates of matches over time.
